# Project Description
The goal of this program is to create a backup of a selected SQLite database (in this case “Chinook.db”). When run, the program reads the given .db file and creates a .txt file that contains all the SQL statements required to reproduce the .db file elsewhere. Use the Execute.bat file to run the program.
