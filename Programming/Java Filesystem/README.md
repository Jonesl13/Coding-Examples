# Project Description
This program was created to traverse an ext2 file system, essentially a filebrowser. The program is run using the driver class. The “cd [file / folder name] “ command is used to traverse the filesystem, with “cd ..” being used to go back one step. Use the “help” command to list all the other commands.
